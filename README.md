# Short Type Name

A really (really) simple way of extracting
a short type name of the `struct` or `enum`.

## Rationale

There isn't. I just wanted to make this thing by myself.

I always say "strings are instant legacy",
so I avoid using them to define the behavior.
(Say hi to `Literal["whatever"]` argument type from Python).

This way you can hide strings behind functions
and be safe from stupid bugs.

Anyway, I hope you won't need it. ![:ohh_yeah:](https://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/economy/emoticon/:ohh_yeah:)

## Examples

The Doc-tests provide good enough examples.
