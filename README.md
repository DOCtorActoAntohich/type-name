# Short Type Name

A really (really) simple way of extracting
a short type name of the struct or enum.

## Rationale

There isn't.

I just wanted this functionality for my thing.

(Also wanted to experiment with macros).

## Examples

The Doc-tests provide good enough examples.
Check this out yourself [here](./type-name/src/lib.rs).
